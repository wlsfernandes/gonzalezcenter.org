Gonzalez’s influence on Hispanic theology is profound, as he has been a key figure in elevating the voices and perspectives of Hispanic Christians in theological discourse. Through his writings and teachings, he has addressed issues of cultural identity, social justice, and the relevance of biblical texts in the experiences of Latino communities. His work has fostered a deeper understanding of the intersection between faith and culture, promoting a more inclusive theological landscape that honors the rich diversity within Christianity. By mentoring young theologians, Gonzalez continues to inspire the next generation to explore and articulate their own theological insights, further enriching the field of Hispanic theology.',
    'justo_legacy' => 'Gonzalez Legacy',
    'justo_legacy_1' => 'Justo Luis González was born in August 1937 in Havana, Cuba. In his formative years, his parents would lay the groundwork for his career that has spanned more than 60 years. His mother, Luisa Garcia Acosta, was an educator, professor of Spanish literature, and author of numerous books on Spanish grammar. His father, Justo González Carrasco, was a novelist, a newspaper editor, and an employee of Cuba’s department of agriculture, where his main job was to take articles that scientists had written on such subjects as agriculture, hygiene, and herbal medicine and rewrite them in such a way that persons with scant formal education could understand them and apply what they had read. Justo’s father would often say that if one could not explain a difficult idea in simple terms, then one did not really understand it.',
    'justo_legacy_2' => 'That truth was borne home to Justo when in the third grade he showed his father an essay that the little boy’s teacher had praised. After reading it over, his father asked his son, “What did you want to say?” The young Justo explained; his father asked him one further question, “Then why didn’t you say it?”',
    'justo_legacy_3' => 'Justo has carried that lesson with him in everything he writes, taking difficult concepts and explaining them in terms that anyone, regardless of that person’s educational background, can understand. It is a hallmark of his more than a hundred and fifty books, which include The Story of Christianity (2 vols.), A History of Christian Thought (3 vols.), and Acts: The Gospel of the Spirit, that have been published in ten languages.',
    'justo_legacy_4' => 'After obtaining his divinity degree from the Seminario Evangélico de Teología in Matanzas, Cuba in 1957, being ordained as a Methodist minister that same year, and completing his PhD in historical theology at Yale University in 1961–at the age of 23–, he went to Puerto Rico, where he taught church history at the Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico for eight years. He then taught at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, leaving there in 1977. For more than forty-five years Justo has focused on developing programs for the theological education of Hispanics, resulting in the founding of the Hispanic Summer Program (HSP), the Asociación para la Educación Teológica Hispana (AETH), and the Hispanic Theological Initiative (HTI). The significance of his work has been acknowledged by numerous awards and recognitions, including seven honorary doctorates, the “Lifetime Achievement Award” from the Association of Theological Schools, and above all, by a world-wide readership.',
    'justo_legacy_5' => 'In his “retirement,” Justo continues to write, lecture, and inspire generations of church leaders,
particularly Hispanics.',
    'justo_legacy_6' => 'He is married to the Rev. Dr. Catherine Gunsalus González, often his co-author and co-lecturer.

    'catherine_gonzalez_profile' => 'Catherine Gunsalus González was born on May 20, 1934, into a family that has rich ties to the history of the United States. In fact, the Upstate-New-York farm, just outside of Binghamton, that her family has owned for several generations–and where her mother was born–was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Her family moved to suburban New York City in 1943 but spent most summers on that farm, a place that holds fond memories for Catherine. She was educated in New York public schools and attended Beaver College (now Arcadia University), graduating with a B.A. in history and government, after forsaking a major in home economics. Catherine attended Boston University where she received both her seminary and doctoral degrees in theology. After graduation in 1965, she taught at West Virginia Wesleyan College and that same year was ordained as a Minister of Word and Sacrament by the United Presbyterian Church. In 1970, Catherine began teaching at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, where she was the first female faculty member. When she joined the faculty of Columbia Theological Seminary as professor of church history in January 1974, she was again the first female faculty member. The move to Atlanta, Georgia and Columbia Theological Seminary came about because Catherine married Justo L. González, who was then teaching at Emory University, three miles from Columbia. Catherine paved the way for several other female faculty members who came in her wake. She retired in 2002 from Columbia as Professor Emerita but continued teaching courses at the seminary for several years.',
    'catherine_gonzalez_contributions' => 'Marrying Justo was an education in and of itself. Never having been to Latin America, Catherine’s rapid immersion in issues surrounding Hispanic theological education began on their honeymoon---and continued with Justo’s lecturing in various places or gathering data for reports on theological education opportunities. Especially in the ‘80s and ‘90s they often lectured together, combining Bible studies with the concerns about gender and racial equality. Catherine would lecture on issues of racial equality; Justo would tackle issues of gender equality. This division represents the sharing of concerns and support of each other’s interests that have long characterized their 50+ years of married life.',
    'catherine_gonzalez_impact' => 'As they moved into “retirement,” their extensive travel schedules increased, parallelling Catherine’s increasing interest in the historic Hispanic churches in this country and the rapidly developing immigrant churches.',
    'catherine_gonzalez_impact2' => 'Post-pandemic, mobility issues have limited Catherine’s travel, but she still finds time to continue her work in theology and history and to indulge her passions for cooking and nutrition as well as reading mystery stories and cheering for the Atlanta Braves.',

        'p1' => 'Asociación para la Educación Teológica Hispana (AETH) was founded in 1992, at the Primer Encuentro of Hispanic Church Leaders and Educators. From its outset, it sought to bring together a wide gamut of people engaged in theological studies: professors and students in Bible colleges, Bible institutes and research universities, pastors, denominational leaders, and others. One of its main purposes has been to promote contact and cross fertilization among these different groups, for the benefit of church and society.',
        'p2' => 'In 2011, AETH decided to establish the Justo González Theological Resource Center to meet the need for accessible and affordable Hispanic-focused and relevant theological resources. The Center was later renamed the Justo and Catherine González Resource Center in recognition of Dr. Catherine Gunsalus González’s significant contribution to theological education and of her commitment to the ministry of AETH. It was created as a program of AETH and was, among other things, to house the extensive collection of the Gonzalezes’ writings and the memorabilia accumulated over their long careers in theological education.',
        'p3' => 'That year, the AETH board of directors decided to accept the invitation from Asbury Theological Seminary to have its Orlando extension serve as host to AETH. For the next decade, Asbury’s facility in Orlando was the home of the Center as well as of AETH’s headquarters, which shared the same staff. In 2021, Asbury Seminary decided to sell its property in Orlando, and AETH and the González Center had to find new homes.  ',
        'p4' => 'AETH now functions as a virtual organization, with its staff working remotely. The only portion of the organization that required a physical space was the Center, with all its books, awards, plaques, and honorary doctoral hoods given to the Gonzalezes. The Cooperative Baptist offered space in its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Since 2021, the Center’s space at CBF has functioned, as Dr. Jessica Lugo, the Executive Director of AETH, says, “the physical footprint of AETH.”',
        'p5' => 'With the wonderful space offered by CBF, the Center has been able to focus on a core mission with its goals and vision clearly defined.',
